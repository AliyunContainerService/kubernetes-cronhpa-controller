## Overview 
`kubernetes-cronhpa-controller` is a kubernetes cron horizontal pod autoscaler controller using `crontab` like scheme. You can use `CronHorizontalPodAutoscaler` with any kind object defined in kubernetes which support `scale` subresource(such as `Deployment` and `StatefulSet`). 


## Installation 
1. install CRD 
```$xslt
kubectl apply -f config/crds/autoscaling.alibabacloud.com_cronhorizontalpodautoscalers.yaml

2. install RBAC settings 
```$xslt
# create ClusterRole 
kubectl apply -f config/rbac/rbac_role.yaml

# create ClusterRolebinding and ServiceAccount 
kubectl apply -f config/rbac/rbac_role_binding.yaml
```
3. deploy kubernetes-cronhpa-controller 
```$xslt
kubectl apply -f config/deploy/deploy.yaml

```

if the `State` of cronhpa job is `Succeed` that means the last execution is successful. `Submitted` means the cronhpa job is submitted to the cron engine but haven't be executed so far. Wait for 30s seconds and check the status.

üçªCheers! It works.

## Implementation Details
The following is an example of a `CronHorizontalPodAutoscaler`. 
```$xslt
apiVersion: autoscaling.alibabacloud.com/v1beta1
kind: CronHorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  labels:
    controller-tools.k8s.io: "1.0"
  name: cronhpa-sample
  namespace: default 
spec:
   scaleTargetRef:
      apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
      kind: Deployment
      name: nginx-deployment-basic
   jobs:
   - name: "scale-down"
     schedule: "30 */1 * * * *"
     targetSize: 1
   - name: "scale-up"
     schedule: "0 */1 * * * *"
     targetSize: 3
``` 
The `scaleTargetRef` is the field to specify workload to scale. If the workload supports `scale` subresource(such as `Deployment` and `StatefulSet`), `CronHorizontalPodAutoscaler` should work well. `CronHorizontalPodAutoscaler` support multi cronhpa job in one spec. 

The cronhpa job spec need three fields:
* name    
  `name` should be unique in one cronhpa spec. You can distinguish different job execution status by job name.
* schedule     
  The scheme of `schedule` is similar with `crontab`. `kubernetes-cronhpa-controller` use an enhanced cron golang lib Ôºà<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ringtail/go-cron">go-cron</a>Ôºâ which support more expressive rules. 
  
  The cron expression format is as described below: 
  ```$xslt

    Field name   | Mandatory? | Allowed values  | Allowed special characters
    ----------   | ---------- | --------------  | --------------------------
    Seconds      | Yes        | 0-59            | * / , -
    Minutes      | Yes        | 0-59            | * / , -
    Hours        | Yes        | 0-23            | * / , -
    Day of month | Yes        | 1-31            | * / , - ?
    Month        | Yes        | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | * / , -
    Day of week  | Yes        | 0-6 or SUN-SAT  | * / , - ?    
  ```
  #### Asterisk ( * )    
  The asterisk indicates that the cron expression will match for all values of the field; e.g., using an asterisk in the 5th field (month) would indicate every month.
  #### Slash ( / )    
  Slashes are used to describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59/15 in the 1st field (minutes) would indicate the 3rd minute of the hour and every 15 minutes thereafter. The form "*\/..." is equivalent to the form "first-last/...", that is, an increment over the largest possible range of the field. The form "N/..." is accepted as meaning "N-MAX/...", that is, starting at N, use the increment until the end of that specific range. It does not wrap around.    
  #### Comma ( , )      
  Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using "MON,WED,FRI" in the 5th field (day of week) would mean Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.  
  #### Hyphen ( - )     
  Hyphens are used to define ranges. For example, 9-17 would indicate every hour between 9am and 5pm inclusive.   
  #### Question mark ( ? )      
  Question mark may be used instead of '*' for leaving either day-of-month or day-of-week blank.
  #### Predefined schedules
  You may use one of several pre-defined schedules in place of a cron expression.
  
  Entry                  | Description                                | Equivalent To
  -----                  | -----------                                | -------------
  @yearly (or @annually) | Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st        | 0 0 1 1 *
  @monthly               | Run once a month, midnight, first of month | 0 0 1 * *
  @weekly                | Run once a week, midnight between Sat/Sun  | 0 0 * * 0
  @daily (or @midnight)  | Run once a day, midnight                   | 0 0 * * *
  @hourly                | Run once an hour, beginning of hour        | 0 * * * *
  Intervals
  You may also schedule a job to execute at fixed intervals, starting at the time it's added or cron is run. This is supported by formatting the cron spec like this:
  
  @every <duration>
  where "duration" is a string accepted by time.ParseDuration (http://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).
  
  For example, "@every 1h30m10s" would indicate a schedule that activates after 1 hour, 30 minutes, 10 seconds, and then every interval after that.
  
  Note: The interval does not take the job runtime into account. For example, if a job takes 3 minutes to run, and it is scheduled to run every 5 minutes, it will have only 2 minutes of idle time between each run.
  
  more schedule scheme please check this <a target="_blank" href="https://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron">doc</a>.
  #### Specific Date (@date)
  You may use the specific date to schedule a job for scaling the workloads. It is useful when you want to do a daily promotion.  
   
  Entry                       | Description                                | Equivalent To
  -----                       | -----------                                | -------------
  @date 2020-10-27 21:54:00   | Run once when the date reach               | 0 54 21 27 10 *
                              
* targetSize     
  `TargetSize` is the size you desired to scale when the scheduled time arrive. 
  
* runOnce    
  if `runOnce` is true then the job will only run and exit after the first execution.
  
* excludeDates      
  excludeDates is a dates array. The job will skip the execution when the dates is matched. The minimum unit is day. If you want to skip the date(November 15th), You can specific the excludeDates like below.
  ```$xslt
    excludeDates:
    - "* * * 15 11 *"
  ```

## Common Question  
* Cloud `kubernetes-cronhpa-controller` and HPA work together?       
Yes and no is the answer. `kubernetes-cronhpa-controller` can work together with hpa. But if the desired replicas is independent. So when the HPA min replicas reached `kubernetes-cronhpa-controller` will ignore the replicas and scale down and later the HPA controller will scale it up.
